# ADR 2. Rebrand documentation website

## Context

The "Design System" terminology has been confusing with people outside the Library Design System Team.

## Decisions

We would be better served naming this website with words our audience (library employees) is familiar with.

"Web Design Standard Practice Guide"
"Web Design SPG"

The website serves to provide guidelines for employees to meet our commitment to

- making digital services and [spaces welcoming and affirming to all](https://www.lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility)
- meet our responsibility to legal, good industry practice, and library best practices

This decision was informed by the [GOV UK Naming your service guide](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service).

- describe a task, not a technology
- donâ€™t need to change when policy or technology changes
- are verbs, not nouns

What is a SPG?
