We sometimes refer to our audience broadly as “students, faculty, and staff,” but it’s important to remember that within these groups are people with a wide range of experiences and needs.

This includes people who:

- Have time pressures, are stressed, or are multitasking
- Speak English as a second language
- Are new to academia or university life
- Have cognitive, visual, or motor disabilities
- Use assistive technologies
- Are new to the United States and U.S. culture
- Are new transfer students
- Are guests or visitors, who may not have authentication privileges

One reason we use <plain language> and follow <accessibility principles> is to make sure we’re doing our best to reach everyone who wants to use our spaces and services.

And remember, no one person represents a group. Be careful not to make assumptions about the people you’re addressing.

## Best practices 

- Use inclusive language
- Recognize and eliminate racist phrases and terms
- Write with accessibility in mind

## Use inclusive language

We write with care to acknowledge our users and make them feel welcome at the library.

This includes working to actively reduce harm with language, recognizing that the impact of our words matter more than our intention.

Don’t exclude people by using terms that reinforce a static gender binary.

And when referencing someone’s profession, use neutral, non-gendered language.
