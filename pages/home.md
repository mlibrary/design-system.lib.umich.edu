<h1 class="page-heading">Mission and Values</h1>

<div class="page-content prose">
  <p>We are a culture and place of sustained and supported innovation. We are indispensable partners in the world-changing work of the university, as we continually reinvent the library as the platform that enables discovery, teaching, learning, health, invention, and creative expression.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>

  <p>Our mission is to support, enhance, and collaborate in the instructional, research, and service activities of faculty, students, and staff, and contribute to the common good by collecting, organizing, preserving, communicating, sharing, and creating the record of human knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Values</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Excellence.</strong> Stay at the leading edge of redefining and reimagining the great research library in the context of an increasingly networked and digital world, while holding true to our broad and enduring mission.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Engagement.</strong>  Deepen our engagement with the core campus missions: discovery, learning, health care, and public service.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Diversity.</strong>  Develop deep skills, individually and collectively, in being a place and community that is inclusive, diverse, and embraces difference.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Interdependence.</strong>  Embrace interdependence and cultivate opportunities to collaborate internally with each other as "One Library," locally with campus partners, and with our peers nationally and internationally.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Humanity.</strong>  Embody integrity, compassion, empathy, equity, and ethical behavior.</p>
