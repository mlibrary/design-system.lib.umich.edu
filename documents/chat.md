      ## When to use this component

      Contact the [Design System team](/help) and we will coordinate with Ask a Librarian staff about your use case.

      ## When to not use this component

      If your website is not hosted on lib.umich.edu.

      ## Guidelines for using the chat component

      - The chat should contrast with the site background.
      
      - Users should have the option to pop the chat out.
      
      - The chat should clearly differentiate which messages are from the user and which are from the library staff member.
      
      - Access to chat should also appear on the “Contact” page. This is a typical place that users will look for it.
      
      - Allow keyboard users to skip ahead to the chat function.

      ## Used by
