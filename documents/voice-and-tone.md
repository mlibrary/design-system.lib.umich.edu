The University of Michigan Library voice is **clear**, **welcoming**, and **helpful**.

The library voice centers the experiences of the people who use our services and spaces, and how they can find and use what they need to get their work done. 

It does not focus on the library as an organization or its accolades. 

## Clear

* Information should be clear and understandable. Use plain English. 
* Do not include jargon and buzzwords. 
* Use simple sentences with shorter words over formal, complex ones. 

## Welcoming

* Be human — write conversationally.
* Use an active voice.
* Use inclusive language. 
* Don't assume your audience will understand the technical terms you use.
* Avoid specialist terms, unless you tell users what they mean in plain English.

## Helpful

* Know that people come to our website or other web applications to complete a specific task or get specific information. 
* Describe only what’s needed. 
* Avoid unnecessary information. 

## Appropriate tone 

Tone, which conveys a mood or feeling, should be based on the situation and audience. When creating content, consider who will read it, why they’ll read it, and where they’ll read it. 

Choosing a tone that’s not appropriate for the situation can create a negative experience for people.
